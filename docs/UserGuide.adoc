== Introduction

Optix is a desktop application made for users who want to manage the seating of a theatre or other venues while keeping track of the finances earned. Optix is optimised for users who can type fast and prefers using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to other methods. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is also developed for additional user interaction. Want to skip the process of going through multiple steps to manage bookings and viewing your profits? If you can type fast and want to avoid this hassle, Optix is the perfect application for you! Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

. Download the latest `optix.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

== Features

=== Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in add `SHOW_NAME|SCHEDULED_DATE|PRICE`, the `SHOW_NAME`, `SCHEDULED_DATE`, and `PRICE` are parameters that can be used as `add Phantom of the Opera|5/5/2020|20`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times (minimally once).
e.g. `SEAT` can be used as `A1 A2 B6` etc.

* Parameters have to be in order.
e.g. if the command specifies `SHOW_NAME|SHOW_DATE`, `SHOW_DATE|SHOW_NAME` is invalid.

* All `SHOW_DATE` entered must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy


* All *COMMAND* and `SHOW_NAME` are case insensitive.
